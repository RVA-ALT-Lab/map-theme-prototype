# Map Tool Theme

This is a WordPress theme that uses leaflet.js and Mapbox to create a custom mapping application for use with students and faculty.

It is pretty non-standard, so it is designed to provision all of the necessary pages and assign them templates on activation:

*Sample Page -> Front Page
*Add Point (/add-point) -> Page to add map points
*Points (/points) -> Page that lists map points
*Map (/map) -> Aggregate and individual map display. The points displayed here are mainly controlled by JS.
